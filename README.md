## Analyzing the Factors that Impact Airbnb Ratings: A Machine Learning Approach

This project focused on understanding the factors that impact Airbnb ratings. By analyzing the data of properties listed in California, Oregon, and Washington, the project aimed to provide insights to hosts that could help them improve their ratings and attract more guests. 

We started with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain a better understanding of the data and then used various machine learning models to determine which features had the most significant impact on Airbnb ratings. The models used in the project included Linear Regression, CV Lasso, PCA, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM. These models were used to identify the most important features for Airbnb ratings and predict the ratings based on these features.

Their performance was compared using Mean Squared Error. The analysis showed that Lasso Regression has the minimum MSE among all the modes. LightGBM has the minimum MSE amoung tree based models. Based on the findings, the project provided recommendations to hosts on ways to improve their Airbnb ratings by focusing on the factors that matter most to guests. 

Overall, this project demonstrates the importance of data analysis and modeling in providing valuable insights for business decision-making. By using machine learning models to analyze the data, the project was able to identify the most significant factors that impact Airbnb ratings, which could help hosts improve their ratings and attract more guests.
